🚖 **NYC Taxi Trip Data Analysis (20M+ Trips, March 2025)**

This project is an end-to-end analysis of NYC Taxi Trip data (20M+ records, March 2025) using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning.
The goal was to uncover trip patterns, passenger behavior, fare distribution, and demand forecasting to enable smarter decision-making for transportation planning.

🔧 **Tech Stack**

**Programming & Libraries**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

**Database**: MySQL (Summarized Reports, Stored Procedures, Query Optimization)

**Visualization**: Power BI (Interactive Dashboards)

**Machine Learning**: Anomaly Detection, Zone Clustering (demand levels), Forecasting Demandlevels and trip volume

📂 **Project Workflow**

**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – handled missing values, outliers, and formatted datetime features using Pandas.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – trip metrics, pickup location trends, airport trips analysis.

**SQL Analysis** – summarized reports, indexing, stored procedures for efficiency and reusability in MySQL

**Power BI Dashboard** – interactive dashboard covering variety of trip metrics patterns, Location analysis to draw insights.

**Machine Learning Models** – applied anomaly detection, clustering for zones (demand-level), and forecasting for trip volume & demand levels.
