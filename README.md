## 🚖 NYC Taxi Trip Data Analysis (20M+ Trips, March 2025)

This project is an **end-to-end analysis** of NYC Taxi Trip data (20M+ records, March 2025) using **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning**.  

The goal was to uncover **trip patterns, passenger behavior, fare distribution, and demand forecasting** to enable smarter decision-making for transportation planning.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Programming & Libraries:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Database:** MySQL (Summarized Reports, Stored Procedures, Query Optimization)  
- **Visualization:** Power BI (Interactive Dashboards)  
- **Machine Learning:** Anomaly Detection, Zone Clustering (demand levels), Demand & Trip Volume Forecasting  

## 📂 Project Workflow
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – handled missing values, outliers, and formatted datetime features using Pandas.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – trip metrics, location trends, airport trips, congestion analysis.  
- **SQL Analysis** – summarized reports, indexing, stored procedures for efficiency and reusability in MySQL.  
- **Power BI Dashboard** – interactive dashboard covering trip metrics, location insights.  
- **Machine Learning Models** – applied anomaly detection, clustering for demand zones, and forecasting for trip volume & demand levels.
