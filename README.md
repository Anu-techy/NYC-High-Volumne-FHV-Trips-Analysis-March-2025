**About Data**

TLC Trip Record Data

Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pickup and drop-off dates/times, pickup and drop-off locations,
trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

Yellow taxis are the only vehicles permitted to respond to a street hail in all five boroughs without a pre-booked ride.

Green taxis may respond to street hails, but only in the areas indicated in green on the map. 
(i.e. above W 110 St/E 96th St in Manhattan and in the boroughs).

New York City is made up of **5 boroughs**, which are like big districts or zones:

Manhattan - Financial, business, tourism hub

Brooklyn - Densely populated, arts & culture

Queens - Diverse, home to JFK & LGA airports

Bronx - Residential, Yankee Stadium

Staten Island - More suburban, ferry access to NYC
