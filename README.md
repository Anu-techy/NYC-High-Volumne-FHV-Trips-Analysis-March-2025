🚖 NYC Taxi Trip Data Analysis (20M+ Trips, March 2025)
📖 Overview

This project is an end-to-end analysis of NYC Taxi Trip data (20M+ records, March 2025) using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning.
The goal was to uncover trip patterns, passenger behavior, fare distribution, and demand forecasting to enable smarter decision-making for transportation planning.

🔧 Tech Stack

Programming & Libraries: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Database: MySQL (Summarized Reports, Stored Procedures, Query Optimization)

Visualization: Power BI (Interactive Dashboards)

Machine Learning: Anomaly Detection, Clustering, Trip Volume Prediction

📂 Project Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – handled missing values, outliers, and formatted datetime features using Pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – trip metrics, pickup location trends, airport trips analysis with Matplotlib/Seaborn.

SQL Analysis – summarized reports, indexing, stored procedures for efficiency and reusability.

Power BI Dashboard – interactive dashboard covering pickup behavior, passenger segmentation, fare distribution, and payment preferences.

Machine Learning Models – applied anomaly detection, clustering for demand-level zones, and forecasting for trip volume & demand.
